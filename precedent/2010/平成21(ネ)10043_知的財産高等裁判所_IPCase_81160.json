In Japan, although\nthe penalties sometimes appear criminal in nature, the guilty party is not really consideres\ncriminal. In this case, even though Mr. was placed on probation, his probation is not\nsupervised. He is under no restrictions during the probationary period. Mr. was never\narrested or placed under any physical restraint because of his involvement as managing\ndirector. The basis for this treatment is the determination by the Courts that Mr. motives\nwere not criminal in nature and that there were no strong indications of anti-social or\nanti-moral behavior.\n"
