Control of alendronate administration,as in the FIT study,can\nminimize side effects. In the FIT study,40% of the placebo group had upper\ngastrointestinal problems compared to 41.3% in the alendronate-treated group.\nFIT\nOral bisphosphonate therapy in subjects older than 70 years is complicated by\ngastro-esophageal and intestinal difficulties more than in younger patients.\nthe potential side-effects\nIn pigs, the bisphosphonate dose can be reduced without adverse effect\non skeletal response by giving a standard \"daily dose\" every fourth day, or for 5 days out\nof 20 23 .\n3 2c episodic once/week\nepisodic once/week\nmay favor\n2c\npotentially\nepisodic once/week\nonce/week episodic\nonce/week episodic\nmay favor potentially 2c\n2c\nside effects difficulty of\ndosing 2c dosing problem\ndifficulty of dosing side effects\nSome U. S. physicians are reluctant to treat because\nof: a side effects, b difficulty of dosing, and c high cost $700/year . First,\nMerck recently sent a letter to physicians warning of esophagitis. Some physicians report\nthat 5 to 15% of patients experience gastric and/or esophogeal distress, but most have seen\nno side effects. Serious side-effects of ulceration and stricture appear rare 14 . Second,\nsome patients also stop alendronate because of the dosing difficulty. The limited\nbioavailability of alendronate 0.8% requires that it be taken on an empty stomach upon\nawakening with a full glass of water not tea, coffee, or juice , and the patient must\nremain upright for 30 to 60 minutes 15 . A few elderly women can tolerate this regime\nfor a only week or two. a , b\nc Merck\nFirst,\nSecond, a side effects b\ndifficulty of dosing\nThird,\nside effects\nThis antagonism possibly could be a factor in the\nunexpectedly high frequency of side effects and dosing difficulties.\nThe\ndifficulties with oral bisphosphonates may favor their episodic once/week , or cyclical\none week each month administration. Even oral alendronate potentially could be given\nin a 40 or 80 mg dose once/week to avoid dosing problems and reduce costs.\n2c\n2c dosing problems\nHerbert Fleisch\nBISPHOSPHONATES IN BONE DISEASE alendronate is very well tolerated\nup to a daily oral dose of 20mg. At 40mg signs of upper gastrointestinal intolerance may\noccur. alendronate is very well tolerated at the recommended dosage.\nThe American Journal of Medicine\nCharles H. Chesnut, Alendronate Treatment of the Postmenopausal\nOsteoporotic Woman: Effect of Multiple Dosages on Bone Mass and Bone Remodeling\nThe only adverse clinical or laboratory effects that appeared to be\nrelated to alendronate were upper gastrointestinal intolerance and rash. The former\nincluded nausea, dyspepsia, mild esophagitis/gastritis, and abdominal pain, and occurred\nprimarily in the first year during treatment with 40 mg alendronate. Seven and 2 patients\ndiscontinued study participation due to adverse gastrointestinal effects in the first and\nsecond years, respectively. Of these 9 patients withdrawn from alendronate therapy due to\nan adverse upper gastrointestinal effects, 7 were receiving 40 mg and only 1 was receiving\na dose lower than 20 mg.\nTherapy with\nalendronate was associated with few side effects; upper gastrointestinal intolerance was the\nmost common adverse experience,and was usually related to the 40-mg dosage. In this\nstudy, alendronate treatment for 2 years improved and maintained skeletal bone mass. The\noptimal dosage, associated with minimal side effects, appears to be 5 to 10 mg. At such\ndodages, alendronate therapy appeared to be well tolerated and effective for the treatment\nof osteoporosis in postmenopausal women in this study.\nThe New England Journal of Medicine\nUri A. Liberman EFFECT OF ORAL\nALENDRONATE ON BONE MINERAL DENSITY AND THE INCIDENCE OF\nFRACTURES IN POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS\nContinuous therapy with 10 mg of alendronate per day provided maximal efficacy, was\nwell tolerated and is therefore the optimal dose for the treatment of osteoporosis in\npostmenopausal women.\nToday's Therapeutic Trends\nJonathan D. Adachi Osteoporosis Its\nDiagnosis,Management and Treatment with a New Oral Bisphosphonate Agent,\nEtidronate Efficacy of alendronate was demonstrated in a recently\nreported publication. 36 In a three-year randomized, double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled,multicentered study, 994 subjects were treated with either placebo or\nalendronate 5, 10 or 20 mg/day. All were supplemented with calcium 500 mg/day.\nAlendronate produced increases in BMD of the lumbar spine, proximal femur, forearm and\ntotal body at all doses. Increases in BMD continued throughout the three years of study.\nAs the efficacy of 10 mg/day was found to be comparable to that of 20 mg/day, while 5\nmg/day was less effective, 10 mg/day was determined to be the appropriate alendronate\ndose.\nTABLE 1\nBM21,0955\nBM21,0955\n4c\nBM21,0955 3\n4h\na\nb\n4i\nBM21,0955\n4d\nBM21,0955\n4c\nBM21,095\nBM21,0955\nBM21,0955\nBM21,0955\n2 BM21,0955\n3a 3b 3c\nStudies over the past decade have\ngiven physicians confidence that bisphosphonates, and in particular alendronate, are useful\nin treating osteoporosis.
