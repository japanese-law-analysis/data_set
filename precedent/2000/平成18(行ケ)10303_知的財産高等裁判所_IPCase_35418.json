Application is either topical, localized, or systemic. Any\nof these compositions may also include preservatives, antioxidants, antibiotics, immunosuppressants,\nand other biologically or pharmaceutically effective agents which do not exert a detrimental effect on\nthe antibiotic or cells. For treatment of tumors, the composition may include a cytotoxic agent which\nselectively kills the faster replicating tumor cells, many of which areknown and clinically in use.\nj In a preferred form, the composition is administered in combination with a biocompatible\npolymeric implant which releases the antibiotic over a controlled period of time at a selected site.\nExamples of preferred biodegradable polymeric materials include polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters,\npolyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, polyethylene vinyl acetate, and copolymers and blends thereof.\nExamples of preferred non-biodegradable polymeric materials include ethylene vinyl acetate\ncopolymers.\ni j\nk Drugs that prevent or reduce the proliferation of pathological cell types are essential to the\ntreatment and control of various diseases involving undesirable or uncontrolled cell proliferation. But\nantiproliferatives, by definition, must be toxic to certain cell types. It is often not feasible to administer\nthese drugs systemically, because the amounts needed to control the diseased cell types may be toxic or\ndeadly to the patient's normal cells. This difficulty could be circumvented by administering\nantiproliferative agents directly to the site of the undesired cell proliferation. A mechanism is also\nneeded for retaining antiproliferative agents at the disease site, so that they may effectively control the\nproliferation of undesired cells, while being restrained from migrating and damaging normal cell types.\nSpecific diseases and conditions for which site-specific delivery and retention of antiproliferatives\nwould be particularly effective are briefly described below. Each of these conditions involves the\nproliferation of a particular undesirable cell type, and systemic administration of drug therapy for their\ntreatment has not yielded optimal results.\n1. Post-Angioplasty Reocclusion and Restenosis\n2. Rheumatoid Arthritis\n3. Ovarian Cancer\n4. Psoriasis\nl In accordance with the present invention, the above-described compounds are used for\nsiteselective delivery of therapeutic agents, and retention thereof at the selected site. According to a\npreferred aspect of the invention, the therapeutic agent has an anti-proliferative action, useful for the\ntreatment of diseases or other pathological conditions involving cell proliferation.\nSuch chemotherapeutic substances may be selected, for example, from the group consisting of\ncolchicine, vinca alkaloids, taxol and derivatives thereof, which exhibit their bio-effect only upon\nrelease from the compounds.\nk l 1 2\n1 2\n2 1\nm\nn\no\nm o\np Abstract\nA mechanical support or stent containing pharmaceutical agents. The stent can be placed in the wall\nof a blood vessel where it releases pharmaceutical agents to prevent arterial thromboses, platelet\naggregation and/or excessive endothelial cell proliferation at the placement site. The stent may also be\nplaced in a blood vessel, bile duct, ureter, or fallopian tube or other duct or vessel, so that it delivers\ndrugs to specific body sites or organs.\nq Detailed Description of The Invention\nThe mechanical support or stent of this invention may be formed from any of the materials\nemployed in the prior art that are non-toxic to the blood and body tissue and otherwise biocompatable.\nThe stent may be in the form of any structure that successfully preserves the luminal diameter of a\nvessel or duct, and may operate by any mechanism known in the art.\nThe pharmaceutical agents suitable to be employed in this invention are too numerous to list. The\nagents may be anticoagulants, antiplatelet substances, antispasmodics or drugs that inhibit excessive\nendothelial cell growth, or they may be antimicrobial agents, hormones or anticancer drugs, or any\ncombination of these agents, or any others to accomplish any other localized purpose. The precise\ncoating or impregnating of the stent with the pharmaceutical agent will vary depending on the form and\nmaterial of the stent, and upon the pharmaceutical agent employed.\np q\na d\nk\nb p q\nk\na d k i\np q\nc\nc\n\"CAM\"\nangiogenesis\nangiogenesis\nangiogenesis\nCAM\nd\ni The tetracyclines can be\nadministered alone or in combination with, either before, simultaneously, or subsequently\nto treatment using conventional chemotherapeutic or radiation therapy.\nOther chemotherapeutics include carmustine BCNU , 5-fluorouracil, - cyclodextrin,\nvinca allcaloids such as vincristin, taxol and vinblastin, immunotoxins.\nBCNU\nk l\n1 1\nk l\n1 2\nk\nq\n1 2\nAmerican Heart Journal\nWalter R.
