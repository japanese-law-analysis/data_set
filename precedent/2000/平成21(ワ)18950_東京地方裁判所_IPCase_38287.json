Schematic diagram of fluorescence electronic endoscopic system. White p\naper stained with fluorescein was used as the observed object\nA black and white charge-coupled device (CCD) behind the objective lens of\nthe endoscope (GIF-XQ 200, Olympus) picks up the photons of light reflected fro\nm tissue and generates electronic signals for, sequentially, red (R), green (G), and\nblue (B) reflected light. The video processor (CV-200, Olympus) receives these\n3 electronic signals and reconstructs them on a color television monitor. (Fig. 1\n2)\nReconstruction of the R,G, and B channels on the monitor results in an image\nthat shows the stains to be white (bright blue + green + red) and the paper yellow\n(only green+ red) (Fig.13)\nFig.1a-d\nFig.1a-d\nEVIS LUCERA SPECTRUM\nEVIS LUCERA OLYMPUS GIF TYPE FQ260Z\n"
