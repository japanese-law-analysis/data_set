Dual copy allows the user to have two identical sets\nof data on two different DASD volumes within the same subsystem.\nWhen a host program establishes dual copy and identifies two DASD volumes as a duplex pair, the\n3990 model 3 maintains two identical copies of a volume, independent of application-level host\nprogramming. See establish Duplex Pair X'12' on page 159 for information on how to specify a\nprimary and a secondary device.\n3990 3\nDASD\nDASD\n3990 3\nX'12'\nDual copy has four device states:\nDuplex: Has two devices, the primary and the secondary. These devices make up the duplex pair. Only\nthe primary device is functional to the host system.\nAll commands that address the secondary device are rejected, except for the following:\nSuspended Duplex: A state caused by one of two events: 1 a host program requests the state of the\nduplex pair be changed to suspended, or 2 the 3990 Model 3 is unable to synchronize the contents of\nthe two devices, and has stopped duplicate writes.\n2 3990 3\nEstablish Duplex Pair X'12' The order makes a duplex pair from the devices that the\nparameters specify as the primary and secondary devices. It can also restore a duplex pair from a\nsuspended duplex pair or replace a failed duplex device with another device.When possible it also\nreturns the device to the original channel address. X'12'\n6-7 Determine if a copy is required to establish the duplex pair. The values are:\n00 Device are syncronized the data is identical , do not copy to establish the deplex pair.\n01 Copy from the primary to the secondary device to establish the duplex pair. The entire volume will\nbe copied to syncronize the two DASD devices. 6-7\n:\nDASD\nA\nB\nC\ni\nii\nD\nMT MT\n0004 0005\nESTABLISH SPLIT\nESTABLISH REESTABLISH\nRESTORE INCREMENTAL RESTORE\nA\nB\nC\nD\nSPLIT\nii\nSPLIT\nii\nOLTP\nDSS\nA\nB\nESTABLISH\nC SPLIT\nii\nD ESTABLISH REESTABLISH RESTORE INCREMENTAL RESTORE\nIBM Storage Subsystem Library \"IBM 3990 Strage Control\nReference Fifth Edition\", September 1991\nESTABLISH\nESTABLISH\nA\nB\nB\nparallel concurrent\nindependent concurrent\nB\nC i\nC ii\nD\nB\nOLTP\nOLTP\nOLTP\nESTABLISH\nBCV\nC i\nSPLIT\nSPLIT\nSPLIT\nBCV\nNR\nSPLIT\nD\nB\nSPLIT\nC\nSPLIT\nC ii\nSPLIT\nESTABLISH REESTABLISH RESTORE INCREMENTAL RESTORE\nESTABLISH REESTABLISH\nRESTORE INCREMENTAL RESTORE\nESTABLISH REESTABLISH RESTORE\nINCREMENTAL RESTORE\n1 3\nB\n1 SPLIT i\nii\nSPLIT\nC i\nSPLIT\nB\nB\nB\nC i C ii\nB\n1 2\nSPLIT\nC\nSPLIT\nESTABLISH REESTABLISH\nRESTORE INCREMENTAL RESTORE\nESTABLISH\nESTABLISH\nDASD\nDASD\nDASD\nOLTP\nB\nC i C ii D\nB\nparallel operation\nparallel processing\nconcurrent processing\nconcurrent processing\nB\nB\nD\nOS\nD\nB ESTABLISH\nC i\nD\nESTABLISH REESTABLISH RESTORE INCREMENTAL RESTORE\nC i\nD\nC i\nC i\nNR\nBCV\nSPLIT\nSPLIT\nSPLIT\nSPLIT\nC i\nC i\nB\nC i D\nA\nB\nB\nDASD 3990 3\nB\nB\nC\nSPLIT\nSPLIT\nSPLIT\nRESTORE\nRESTORE BCV\nBCV\nBCV\nRESTORE\nBCV SPLIT\nSPLIT\nSPLIT\nESTABLISH REESTABLISH RESTORE INCREMENTAL RESTORE\nESTABLISH ESTABLISH\n2 3\nB\nB\nDASD\nDASD\nCE DE\nDASD 0017\nDASD\nDASD\nDASD\nSPLIT\nC SPLIT i\nC in response to a second command: i detaching the second data storage\nfacility from the first data storage facility independently of operations in response to the\nfirst application C\ni\nSPLIT\nMT\nMT\nOLTP\nRDF\nRDF\nRDF\nRDF\nC i\nOS\nB\nB\nD\n0019 0023\nD\n"
