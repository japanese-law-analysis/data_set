The member 12 also has an\ninner stepped surface. Bristles 13' are attached to the surface 16 which extends in a longitudinal direction\naway from the handle beyond the outer planar surface of the brush head of the flexible extension portion\nand bristles 13 are attached to the brush head surface 15. The bristles 13' contain a plurality of shorter\nbristles near the transition point between the flexible and fixed portions of the toothbrush head so that the\nflexible extended portion of the toothbrush head can flex while avoiding conflict with the bristles 13 of the\nmain head portion of the brush.\nThe flexible extension member 12 is made of rubber, so that the surface thereof can minimize scracthing\nwhile massaging the periodontal tissue surface. Accordingly, the flexible extension member 12 can be used\nto effectively clean the back teeth. 24\n12 18 11\n17 12 13'\n13 15 13'\n12 135\n11 11 12 60\n14 11 12 11 14\n11 11 14\n11 12\n11 11 12 60\n11 12\n12 12 11\n135 12 11\n9-19323\n3a\n3d 4a 4c 0017\n12 11\n150 179\n150 179\n135 150 179\n15 17 126\n159 53\n1 12\n12 11 135\n12 11\n11 12\n150 179\n12 11\n5 63-150647 2-71329 13\n15 13\n16 15\n1 12\n18 11 17\n12 18 11\n12 11\n2 12 17\n17 11\n12 21\n3 150-179\n179 180\n150 -179\n1 The invention being thus described, it will be obvious\nthat the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a\ndeparture from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would\nbe obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included in the scope of the\nfollowing claims. 24 29\n8-502909\n4-84157 6-36421\n63-150647 2-71329\n1-190307\n150-179 179\nBriefly described, the present invention relates to a toothbrush having\na flexible extension containing a plurality of bristles and a flexible element which covers\nthe back of the head for minimizing scratches on the periodontal tissue surface of the oral\ncavity. 40 44\nAs\nshown in FIGS.2 and 4, the flexible extension member 12 includes a cover 17 which is\nattached to the outer planar surface of the brush head 11 by an adhesive 18.
