  "contents": "---\nThe timing sequence of LCD scan during which all pixels are addressed , pixel transmittance\nchanges to form the next image component, and light source turn on and turn off when a small number\nof lamps is used for full resolution 3-D imaging as in FIG. 2 is shown in FIG.s 3a - 3c.\nThe timing diagram is shown in FIG.s 3a - 3c. FIG. 3a depicts the repeated address of LCD rows\nstarting at the top row and proceeding to the bottom row. FIG. 3b shows the change from \"off\" or\nopaque state to \"on\" or clear state or vice versa of the first and the last pixels in a video field, after\nthese pixels have been addressed, and the flashing of the first light emitting point or lamp 42 shown in\nFIG. 2. In the case of TFT and Ferroelectric LCDs, when a pixel is turned on during the scan of an\nLCD, it stays on until turned off, in this case until the scan of the entire LCD to display one video\nframe is completed, and the last pixels have had time to change their state.\nAs shown in FIG. 3a the time period between the start of one LCD scan and the start of the next is\ndivided into three periods during which three actions occur: a first period 22 during which the LCD is\nscanned and its rows sequentially addressed usually starting at the top row 20 and ending at the bottom\nrow 21 causing the pixels to change state in order to display the next image, a pause or waiting period\n23 during which nothing happens, and an optional blanking period 24 of beneficial effect in some\nLCDs in which the LCD is scanned again and all the pixels are addressed and made to change state to\neither full on or full off depending on LCD configuration, to completely erase the previous image.\nTypically, all the pixels of a given row are addressed at the same time.\nThe signal to change the states of the first row pixels is given to the LCD 6 at time tg. For illustrative\npurposes, it is assumed that a delay of about 3.5 ms occurs before the pixel completes its change to a\nnew state in response to the applied signal - it begins to turn on at time t and completes the change in\nits state between opaque and clear at time t2 as shown in FIG. 3b. Although in FIG. 3b pixels are\nshown turning between full off and full on it is understood that typically some will be turning from on\nto off and others will turning between one intermediate gray state and another. The last pixel starts its\nstate change at time t3 after it is addressed at time t and completes it at time t4. At this instant the\nvideo frame is complete and the light source 7 flashes, as shown in FIG. 3c, thus transferring the\ninformation in the first field to the observer. As seen in FIG. 3a a pause period 23 during which no\naddressing of the LCD happens is inserted in order to give all the pixels time to change to their new\nstate before the lamp is fired. If the time it takes a pixel to change state is long enough, or the time\nrequired for a scan is short enough, a second scan can occur during the pause period. During the\nsecond scan the same image information is transferred to the LCD as in the first scan. The optional\nblanking scan can then occur followed by the next address of the LCD during which the pixels are\naddressed in order to create the second image field. The sequence in the second frame is the same as in\nthe first frame except that lamp 43 flashes. Likewise, the timing of events is identical in subsequent\nframes, the only difference being the information written to the LCD and which of the lamps flashes.\nAgain as shown in FIG.s 3a - 3c, the pixels take a certain period of time to change state once they are\naddressed. In this case 3.5 ms is shown for illustration, that being the period typical of a custom pixel\nLCD being made by an LCD development lab for Dimension Technologies Inc. The time required to\nturn off from full on may be different than the time required for full on to full off, or the time required\nto change between various intermediate gray levels. In such cases, the longest time period required to\nchange between two states is most relevant, and must be accommodated so that all pixels, regardless of\nwhich states the change to or from, can complete their change before a lamp is fired.\nLamps, of course, never flash instantaneously, but rather emit light for a short time and then turn off.\nThe duration that the lamp is emitting light depends on the lamp, and can be controlled with some\nlamps, such as LEDs. In general, the lamp should emit light only during the time period between the\ncompletion of the last pixel*s change and the beginning of the next address scan. However, if a\nblanking scan is used, and the LCD is blanked to a dark state, the lamps may emit light during the\nblanking period without significant image degradation. However, if the LCD is blanked to the bright or\ntransparent state, the lamps should stop emitting light before the blanking period begins. Otherwise,\ncontrast will be lessened considerably.\nA total of 16.7 ms has elapsed from the time the turn on signal has been applied to the first pixel to\nthe completion of the change in state of the last pixel and flash of the light source, and blanking at all\nthe pixels, and beginning of the next scan. Thus, there are 60 fields per second or 30 images video\nframes per second. This frame frequency will result in a nearly flickerless image in this particular\nconfiguration given typical screen sizes and brightness levels. Other configurations in which more than\ntwo sets of light lines or spots are created may require higher frame frequencies to avoid flicker. This\nscanning, changing, and flash sequence proceeds continuously, as subsequent image frames, each\nconsisting of two sequential fields made visible to the observer by means of two lamp flashes, are\ndisplayed. The two image fields each consist of interleaved right and left eye members of a stereopair\nimage as described in US-A-5,036,385. 29 35 32 27\n1 2\n2 3\nDimensionTechnologiesInc.\n38 40 22\nTurning now to the system embodiment of Figure 2, then following the writing of data for one\nTV field into the display panel 10 in a display information address period comprising one half the TV\nsignal field period as previously described, the picture elements of the array are addressed again in the\ninterval comprising the remaining half of the TV signal field period to drive them to their substantially\nnon-transmissive, black, state, unlike the scheme described in EP-A-0487140 in which the picture\nelements are addressed again with the same display information in the second half of the TV field\nperiod. To achieve this, selection signals are again supplied by the row driver circuit 20 to each of the\nrow conductors in turn during this interval corresponding to the latter half of the TV field period with\nthe selection signal of the first row conductor coinciding substantially with the beginning of the\ninterval. For the duration of this period a predetermined reference voltage, VB, is applied to each of the\ncolumn conductors 1 6, which is selected such that the picture elements are driven to their substantially\nnon-transmissive state. The reference voltage is applied by means of a switch circuit 35 connected\nbetween the outputs of the column driver current 22 and the set of column conductors which switches\nthe column conductors between the column driver circuit's outputs and the reference voltage under the\ncontrol of a switching signal S supplied by the circuit 21. The row conductors are scanned with a\nselection signal at the same rate as previously so that the rows of picture elements are set to their\nsubstantially non-transmissive states in sequence with the final rows being set close to the end of the\ninterval. In one TV field period, therefore, there are two display panel address periods namely a display\ninformation address period in which the picture elements are driven to the required display states and a\nsucceeding interval in which they are driven to their substantially non-transmissive states.\nAt the end of the TV field period, the change-over switches 28 and 32 are operated, and the switch\ncircuit 35 reset, so that the data signals for the next TV field are read out to the circuit 24 from the\nother store, again at twice the field rate of the TV signal and in synchronism with scanning of the row\nconductors at twice the conventional rate and while the subsequent TV field is being loaded into the\nfirst store. After this next field has been loaded into the display panel, the picture elements are again\ndriven to their substantially non-transmissive display states as before in the remaining latter half of the\nTV field period. This manner of operation is repeated for successive TV fields.\nThus, the operation of the display panel occupies a succession of approximately equal periods of time,\neach corresponding to approximately one half of the TV signal field period, e.g. 10ms, in which\nalternate periods constitute first display panel field periods during which the picture elements are\nloaded with display information for a respective TV field and in which the intervening intervals\nconstitute second display panel field periods during which the picture elements of the array are driven\nto their black state. This is depicted diagrammatically in Figure 4 in which T represents time and F A\nto F D denote four successive field periods of the applied TV signal, VS. The relative timings of\nthe operating periods of the display panel, DP, are illustrated in which f A to f C represent the first\ndisplay panel field display information address periods, and the periods f represent the intervals\ntherebetween constituting the second display panel address periods. 18 11 20\n18 19 13\n0017 0031\nthe problem of unwanted visual effect\nwhen displaying moving images\n20 21  to alleviate\nthereby resulting in the improvement to the perceived resolution of moving images\n11 12\n0010 0011\nthe lamps may\nemit light during the blanking period\n0004 000\n0006 0007\n- - -\n0009 0012\n2 1\nlook around\nIn the case of TFT and Ferroelectric LCDs\nLCDs\nIn the case of TFT and Ferroelectric LCDs\nIn the case of TFT LCD and Ferroelectric LCD\nthe lanps may emit light during the\nblanking period without significant image degradation.\nmay\n2 1\nflip\n"
